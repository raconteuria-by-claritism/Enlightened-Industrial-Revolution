# Enlightened-Industrial-Revolution

The directiories for most components mentioned in the Press Release on 2022-11-17 are here. The only exception is Missile8964 and by extension OCA on Cameras and Automobile. They are hardware oriented and complex on their own.

Corrugated Carton - 2mm thickness for the material
  
  furnnitures
  - Designes with multiple slices needs to have a standardized reference number and qrcode.
  - Each design "slice" also needs to define the overall thickness when finished and the minimal dimension of each uncut slice

Cardboard Boxes - 1mm thickness for the material
  - They come in fixed standard sizes so they can be stacked for either ReSpank or PreIncarnate.
  - Please limit the printables to the dimensions of the sides.
  - Please limit the designs of the invertables to the standard sizes as well.

Drawer Boxes - 2mm thickness for the material
  - Same dimensions as the Cardbaord Boxes, however, these will be made into easily reuseable drawers that are thicker and more structural rigidity.
  - In theory, this one only needs the front inserts. As this one just occurs to me on 2022-11-30, I'll put up a prototype desing before 2022-12-07.

Styrofoam Frames
  - The pillars are standard, no need to do much other than 3D files
  - The corners can be scaled to fit 30x30mm to 30x60mm to 60x60mm pillars so each type needs 3 sizes
  - The same applies to the middles.

Plastic Containers
  - Most containers can be square, other than carbonated liquids.
  - Two Sets
    - Regular cubic shapes
    - a few cylindrical containers ( ie, Cylindryical confined to a 100x050x050mm pillar shape for sodas )
  - 2mm thickness for the walls, it is overkill in some cases, but the tradeoff of ditching recycling is worth it.

Storage Strucgure
  - The dimensions allows for a personal / home / office storage system that is space optimized.
  - They will easily fit into a "Saga-Egg", the Universal Garanteed Habitate.
