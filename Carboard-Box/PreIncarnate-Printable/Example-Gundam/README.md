Gundam RX-78 Paper Models

I found these in about 2005? I don't remember where I downloaded them and I have no idea who made them. 
I have no intent to infringe upon anyone's copyright so I hereby, declare : I didn't draw them.

However, if the original creator will step forwared and identify yourself with proof. 
I would hope humanity can have the honour of using your amazing work to demonstrate what is possible for humanity.

Again, I thank whoever drew these and if you agree with me, please leave a think you here or in your own way.

---

Everyone, start your upload engine of your original creations, and please leave a name or handle for humanity to honour you.
Or if you prefer, leave your contact info so contract and gloriously paying work/contracts can find you.
